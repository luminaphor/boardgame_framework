Game Mechanics
--------------
Series of rounds.
Each round consists of 3 phases, resolved in the following order.
    -Action Phase, investigators perform actions to move about game board and prep.
    -Encounter Phase, Investiagors fight Monsters, reoslve encounter cards on current space.
    -Mythos Phase, LI resolves one Mythos card. These cards often advance doom token, spawn gates
    or rasie other challenges.
    -At end of each Mythos phase, LI may pass LI token to any player of his choice.
    PLayers then start a new round by beginning with the Action Phase.
    Players continue resolving game rounds until they have won or lost.
PHASE I- Action Phase
Each player resolves up to two actions. 
Start with LI, he performs 2 actions, then next player performs 2 actions, and so on.
The following actions may be performed:
    -travel (move token to any adjacent space. May spend any number of travel tickets
    to move one additional space per ticket spent. )
    -rest (recover 1HP, 1S. CANNOT be performed if there is a monster on that space.
    -trade (may trade posessions such as Assets, artifacts, clues, spells, tickets with another
    investigator on their space.)
    -prep for travel (if on city space, gain 1 TT of his choice. Cannot gain train/ship ticket 
    unless at least one ship path connected. Cannot have > 2 travel tickets. Choose 2, discard the rest.)
    -acquire assets (If on city space, Test influence. may attempt to cquire asssrts with
     total value <= num successes rolled. If no cards gained, investigator may discard 1 card of his/her
     choice from reserve. After performing action, replace any cards removed from reserve by 
     drawing replacements from Asset deck. Cannot perform this action if monster on space.)
    -component actions (investiagor may perform action listed on one of his components such as 
    card or investigator sheet. Although an investigator cannot perform a component action
    from a single component more than once each round, he can perform component actions of different components.
    A player may also perform actions held by other investigators in their space. These are preceded
    as local actions.)
Each player can perform each actin only ONCe during a round. 

PHASE II - Encounter Phase
Each investigator resolves one encounter. 
If a player is on a space containing one or more monsters, he must resolve a single combat
encountrer against each monster on that space, one at a time, in order of choice.
If there are zero monsters on an investigators space, he instead resolves a location encounter 
or token encounter of his choice as described.
    Combat Encounter- if >=1 monster on player space, must resolve a combat encounter. 
    After resolving all combat encounters, if there are no monsters in space, may resolve another.
    Location Encounter- draw an encounter card matching spaces artwork or from general encouner deck.
    Resolves effect matching current space, resolves card.
    If there are multiple types of encouner cards that can be drawn, choose a deck to draw from.
    Token Encounters - Some tokens get placed on baord to provide 
    additional encounter options. 
        -Clues allow investigators to 
        draw and resolve research encounter cards.
        -Gate tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve other world encounter cards
        -Active expedition tokens allow investigators to draw and resolve expedition encounter
        cards.
        -Rumor tokens allow investigators to resolve the encounter listed on the rumor mythos
        card that refers to that space.
        -Defeated investigator tokens allow investigators to resolve the encounter
        listed on the bak of the defeated investigators sheet.

PHASE III - Mythos Phase
LI draws top card of mythos deck. 7 posible effects, LI resolves in order they appear. L->, from top
    Advance Omen- move omen token 1 space around track. Advance doom by 1 for each gate on game board
    that matches omen tokens current space.
    Reckoning- Resolve all effects proceeded by reckoning icon on components in play. 
    Resolves these in the following order:
    Monsters -> AO sheet -> Ongoing Mythos cards -> investiagor posessions/conditions
    Spawn Gates- Spawn num gates as defined by ref
    Monster Surge - At each gate matching omen tokens current space, spawn num monsters listed 
    on ref card. If no matching gates crrently on board, spawn a gate instead.
